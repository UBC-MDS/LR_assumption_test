# LR_assumption_test

A package containing functions to test linearity assumptions for linear regression performed on single or multiple linear regression for a specified dataset

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install LR_assumption_test
```

## Usage

- TODO

## Ecosystem

As of January 2022, there are no other packages that we have found which explicitly evaluate the assumptions made by linear regression. The LR_assumption_test package seeks to fill in this gap and build upon existing python packages. This package aggregates the functions offered by scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy.stats, matplotlib and more, seeking to build upon them for the purpose of evaluating linear regression models. This is intended to make it more accessible for users to access the functionality of the previously mentioned packages, as well as improve the clarity of results.
